## üß† **Abstract (Refined)**

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on standardized benchmarks, but their true capabilities in dynamic, real-world environments remain underexplored. This study evaluates LLMs across a range of interactive and adaptive tasks. Key findings include:

* **Model size vs. prompt quality**: Larger models consistently outperform smaller ones, but the performance gap can be significantly reduced through strategic prompting.
* **Prompt length matters**: Excessively long prompts degrade performance, especially in smaller models.
* **Prompting techniques**: Advanced methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Reflection are beneficial for smaller models but yield diminishing returns for larger ones.
* **Generalization limitations**: While techniques like CoT and Reflexion help in some tasks, they do not generalize well across all domains.
* **Lack of human-like intelligence**: Current LLMs fall short in tasks requiring planning, deep reasoning, or spatial coordination.
* **Benchmark limitations**: Standard benchmarks are often static and narrow, failing to capture the messiness and complexity of real-world decision-making.

## üîç **Introduction**

This study presents a **systematic evaluation of LLMs** in dynamic decision-making settings that go beyond traditional static benchmarks. It focuses on how LLMs handle:

* **Prompting strategies** such as:

  * **Reflection** ‚Äì learning from past responses,
  * **Heuristic mutation** ‚Äì modifying prompts based on observed behavior,
  * **Planning** ‚Äì explicit action sequencing for achieving long-term goals.

### üß™ Key Findings:

* **Prompting impact varies with model size**:

  * Smaller models often suffer when subjected to excessive reasoning chains.
  * Larger models show robustness but gain marginal improvements from advanced prompting.
* **Reasoning is not general-purpose**:

  * CoT, Self-Refine, and Reflexion yield **inconsistent improvements** across different tasks.
* **Inadequacy of current benchmarks**:

  * QA datasets and math word problems **overstate LLM reasoning abilities**.
  * **Static tasks** fail to capture the demands of real-world reasoning.

To address this, the authors use **SMARTPLAY** ‚Äì a benchmark of **dynamic-interactive tasks** that reveal genuine reasoning and planning capabilities more effectively.

## üß† **Background**

LLMs are fundamentally trained to **predict the next token**, not to reason, plan, or coordinate actions across time. This creates major limitations when these models are placed in dynamic environments where memory, feedback, and strategy are essential.

### üß∞ **Emerging Prompting Techniques**:

1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)** ‚Äì Encourages step-by-step reasoning.
2. **Self-Refine** ‚Äì Models critique and revise their own outputs iteratively.
3. **ReAct** ‚Äì Combines reasoning with environment-based actions.
4. **Reflexion** ‚Äì Models reflect on previous outcomes to guide future behavior.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **LLM Agent Behavior: Key Enhancements**

* **Iterative Planning Approaches**:

  * **AutoPlan** ‚Äì Replans based on partial progress and new context.
  * **DEPS** ‚Äì Leverages a feedback loop for dynamic adjustment.
  * **RCI** ‚Äì Targets precise task execution in structured environments.

* **Evolutionary Prompt Optimization**:

  * **EvoPrompt** ‚Äì Uses genetic algorithms to evolve effective prompts.
  * **PLUM / LLaMEA** ‚Äì Generate and evaluate diverse prompts, selecting the best-performing variants.

These strategies represent **new directions** for improving LLM performance in more complex, real-world settings.
